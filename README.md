# DigitGuesser
Simple program which uses an MNIST-trained model to predict some drawn digit. Model is trained to 97% accuracy with test samples.   
This project was simply to teach myself about PyTorch and creating GUIs in python.

## How to use
Run ```python3 digitguesser.py```  
   
When prompted, enter the file name of the trained model (model.pt).   
A GUI will appear which will allow you to draw a digit and have the model guess which digit it is.
